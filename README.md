## Capture Toots from new friends at a Conference… Mastodon Toots — not any other kind of toots. 

When talking to people at a conference, it can be hard to remember names, let alone social handles. IceBreakers gives a way to do both while being a **non-alcoholic** social lubricant by making a game of how many new people you can meet as part of a conferences scores in order to win cheap prizes.

Take a selfie with someone and either capture their info, or just quickly AirDrop your pre-saved contact info to them. Either way counts towards your conference’s score!
